# CYBER World Model

Imagine a robot navigating a cluttered room. For it to operate effectively, it needs to "see" beyond raw images—recognizing objects, understanding spatial relationships, and predicting interactions. Physical Encoding achieves this by converting the robot’s visual input into latent codes. These codes represent a distilled understanding of the physical world, akin to how humans quickly grasp the layout of a room upon entering. For example, if the robot sees a chair, the encoded information isn't just "chair" but also its position, how it might be moved, and its potential use in future tasks. This high-level encoding enables the robot to focus on important environmental features and make smarter decisions.

Consider a robot working in a warehouse. As it moves to pick up a box, a worker suddenly enters its path. With Future Prediction, the robot doesn't merely react to the worker's presence—it predicts this interaction before it happens. By combining visual cues (e.g., the movement of the worker) with language tokens (pre-learned descriptions of similar scenarios), the robot forecasts potential outcomes and adjusts its actions preemptively. This is like anticipating a person’s next move in a busy crowd and adjusting your path to avoid a collision. CYBER’s future prediction capability makes the robot proactive, helping it avoid accidents and execute tasks more efficiently.
